# This script serves more as a demonstration of how 
# to combine pyexz3 with coverage tools
# Example command
#    scripts/coverage.sh test/elseif.py
# It does the following steps
# 0: Setup, don't worry about these
# 1: Arguments: the test file (#1) and the solver (#2) - either '--cvc' or '--' (default)
# 2: PyExZ3 expects python 3.2.3 but coverage requires 
# whatever version is installed. Mine happens to be 3.6.5. 
# Before running PyExZ3, this script sets pyenv to use the right version.
# 3: Run pyexz3 as usual, making sure to use the --generate_test_suite flag.
# 4: Switch python versions back to 3.6.5
# 5: Run coverage analysis on the generated test suite
# 6: coverage-specific: generate html output for what has been collected.
# 7: open the html file for the input file (argument).
#		I also recommend checking out htmlcov/index.html for an overview.
